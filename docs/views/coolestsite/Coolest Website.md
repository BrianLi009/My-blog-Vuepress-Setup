I have curated a list of resources that other awesome developers and mathematicians have came up with, and will be sharing them here!

## [Art of Curves](https://maryzam.github.io/Art-of-curves/)

ðŸŒ¹ Math is beautiful. No, really, just look at these curves 
You can download it and run index.html page in your browser or try a live demo to play with different Rose curves.

## [Timeline of Mathematics](https://mathigon.org/timeline/)
A timeline for mathematical development and progress that goes all the way back to stone age!

## [Graph Theory Interactive](https://d3gt.com/)
D3 Graph Theory is a project aimed at anyone who wants to learn graph theory. It provides quick and interactive introduction to the subject. The visuals used in the project makes it an effective learning tool.

## [A game of trust (Game Theory)](https://ncase.me/trust/)
Why, even in peacetime, do friends become enemies?
And why, even in wartime, do enemies become friends?
I think game theory can help explain our epidemic of distrust and how we can fix it!

## [Fourier Transform](http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html)
Fourier transforms are a tool used in a whole bunch of different things. This is an explanation of what a Fourier transform does, and some different ways it can be useful. And how you can make pretty things with it.
