Nothing much going on over the winter break due to COVID, it's hard to feel the holiday vibe this winter. I was able to land a research fellowship under the supervision of Doctor Yiming Qian. He completed his PhD at York University specializing in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. It is quite cool as I get to gain more exposure in these technical fields from an expert. The project itself is related to facial recognition, and hopefully we will have a research paper ready for publish by early 2021.

I received the [NPH playing cards made by theory 11](https://store.theory11.com/products/neil-patrick-harris-playing-cards), it has a very nice puzzle in it with multiple levels, I enjoyed solving it! Seeing how neat this deck of playing card is, I decided to start collecting some more play cards despite the fact that they are not cheap. 

Might update more in the near future...
